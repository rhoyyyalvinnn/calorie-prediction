<h1>Calorie Prediction Web App</h1>
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>This web application allows users to estimate the calorie content of various food items based on their weight in grams. By selecting a food item from a dropdown and inputting the desired weight (in grams), the app will calculate the estimated calorie content for the specified quantity. The app is built using Python, Flask, and JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Key Features:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Dropdown menu to select food items.</li>
  <li>Input field for entering the quantity in grams.</li>
  <li>Calculation of total calories based on the food item and quantity.</li>
  <li>Modal error messages for invalid input.</li>
  <li>Allows users to track the foods they have added with the calories listed.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>The dataset used for this project contains information on the calories in various food items, listed per 100 grams. The data is sourced from the following Kaggle dataset:</p>
<p>Dataset URL: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kkhandekar/calories-in-food-items-per-100-grams?resource=download">Calories in Food Items per 100 grams</a></p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Backend: Python (Flask)</li>
  <li>Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
  <li>Database: In-memory data structure (or optional database setup if extended)</li>
  <li>Deployment: Render</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future Improvements ðŸš€</h2>
<p>If this project were to be developed further, the following enhancements are planned:</p>
<ul>
  <li>User Authentication: Allow users to register and log in to their own accounts.</li>
  <li>Persistent History Tracking: Store each userâ€™s food intake history in a database to help them monitor their daily/weekly calorie consumption.</li>
  <li>Nutritional Analytics: Provide visual summaries (graphs/charts) showing nutrition breakdown over time.</li>
  <li>Meal Planning: Suggest healthy combinations based on daily limits or goals (e.g., weight loss, maintenance, etc.).</li>
  <li>Mobile Responsiveness: Improve UI for better experience on smartphones and tablets.</li>
  <li>Custom Food Items: Let users add custom food entries with personalized calorie data.</li>
</ul>
